# NHSD-Test
This example is for test purposes only. NHS Digital have invested in some tools to capture deployment data. The purpose of collecting the data is to analyse deployment data between projects as a way of optimising our continuous delivery approach.


The script makes use of the following packages for this example:
> json - Module to read data from the json file

> datetime - Module to get/convert to datetime in python

> csv - Module to create and modify csv files

> statistics - Module to carry out quick calculations based on statistics
